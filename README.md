# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data
Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

#Criteria
1. Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

#Source Data
Data + Description can be found here UCI HAR Dataset

#Data Set Information
The experiments have been carried out on a group of 30 volunteers of age between 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) while carrying a Samsung Galaxy S II smartphone. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, their 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity were captured at a constant rate of 50Hz. The obtained data has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data the remaining as the control group, test data.

#Attribute Information
For each record in the dataset it is provided:

Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope.
A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables.
Its activity label.
An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.
